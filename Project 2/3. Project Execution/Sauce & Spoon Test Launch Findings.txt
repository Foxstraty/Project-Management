The test launch is complete and the team has compiled the survey results. Peta’s next task is to identify key data points from the survey responses and prepare a presentation. Her presentation should tell the story of the test launch, including what worked, what didn’t, and recommendations for next steps. She will present her findings to Omar, the CEO, Deanna, the Director of Operations, and several potential investors for the next tablet rollout project at the remaining Sauce & Spoon locations.
