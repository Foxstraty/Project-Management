Omar, the owner of Sauce & Spoon, has requested that Peta expand the tablet rollout to include all dining sections, not just the bar. Deanna expects Peta to do what she can to accommodate an expansion, but Peta feels it is outside the scope of the project. However, because Omar is the owner and a senior stakeholder, Peta decides to get input from other team members. She hopes to identify at least two team members who will support her position on keeping the rollout confined to the bar area. Peta meets with Gilly, Alex, Larissa, Zane, Seydou, and Carter to discuss the pros and cons of expanding the tablet rollout.
