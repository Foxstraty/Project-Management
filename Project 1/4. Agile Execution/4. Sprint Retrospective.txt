The Virtual Verde team has completed the first Sprint based on the Backlog you created in the last activity, Create a Sprint Plan and Sprint Backlog. The team also gathered for a Sprint Retrospective to go over what worked well during the Sprint, and what they want to change for the future. Your team reviewed each item from the Sprint, and discussed how the work went and how the team performed.

After the meeting, you took photos of the whiteboards your team created during the discussion, knowing youâ€™d need the notes to reflect on team accomplishments and what to change for the future.
