As part of the Plant Pals Operations and Training plan, you selected a vendor to install supply chain management software and equipment. In order to ensure the vendor can successfully set up the proper systems, you need to prepare a Statement of Work (SoW). 

For this engagement, the SoW should contain the following elements:

The vendor will configure inventory and fulfillment tracking software for the Office Green team. This includes auditing existing Office Green software and developing optimizations.

The vendor will also install the new software on all Office Green devices and equipment (laptops, mobile devices, and hard drives).

The vendor will install fulfillment equipment in Office Greenâ€™s warehouses.

The vendor will create training manuals and a maintenance guide for the software and equipment.

The vendor will meet with the Training Manager and the HR Specialist to explain the training manuals and answer questions. 

The vendor should complete all tasks within two weeks (10 business days).

The vendor is not responsible for training other employees or ongoing maintenance.

Office Green will pay the vendor once they have completed all of the work.
