As a project manager for Office Green, you are responsible for consulting with team members to identify potential risks for the Plant Pals operations launch. You determine that there are two main risks types you need to plan for:

Going over the project budget

Falling behind the training schedule

Your team identifies three possible risk scenarios for each category:

Budget Risks

Your team’s Fulfillment Director has identified three possible budgetary risks to mitigate:

Each delivery truck costs $16,000 more than initially quoted. Your team estimates a 50% chance this risk will occur. If it does, Office Green would pay $32,000 more than expected for their two delivery trucks. 

A product vendor charges a higher rate than expected. Your team determines a 20%-25% chance this risk will occur. The budget impact would be approximately $17,000.

A product vendor loses a product shipment. Your team estimates only a 5% chance this risk will occur. A lost shipment would cost over $25,000.

Schedule Risks

Your training team is concerned that they could fall behind schedule when training Office Green’s employees, and highlighted three possible scheduling risks:

Your Training Manager gets sick and misses a week of training. Your team estimates a 5%-10% chance this risk will occur. 

You cannot hire enough employees in time to train them before launch. Your team estimates a 20%-30% chance this risk will occur, and it could delay the project by over a month.

More than 50% of employees quit after a difficult training process, leaving the company short-staffed. Your team estimates only a 5% chance this risk will occur.
