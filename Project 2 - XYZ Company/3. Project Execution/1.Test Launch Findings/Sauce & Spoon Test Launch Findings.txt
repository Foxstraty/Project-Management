The test launch is complete and the team has compiled the survey results. PPP’s next task is to identify key data points from the survey responses and prepare a presentation. The presentation should tell the story of the test launch, including what worked, what didn’t, and recommendations for next steps. The findings need to be presented to MMM, the CEO, AAA, the Director of Operations, and several potential investors for the next tablet rollout project at the remaining XYZ Company's locations.
