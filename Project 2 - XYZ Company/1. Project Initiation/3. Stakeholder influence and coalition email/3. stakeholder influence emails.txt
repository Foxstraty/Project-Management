MMM, the owner of XYZ Company, has requested that PPP expand the tablet rollout to include all dining sections, not just the bar. AAA expects PPP to do what she can to accommodate an expansion, but PPP feels it is outside the scope of the project. However, because MMM is the owner and a senior stakeholder, PPP decides to get input from other team members. She hopes to identify at least two team members who will support her position on keeping the rollout confined to the bar area. PPP meets with CCC, DDD, HHH, FFF, KKK, and BBB to discuss the pros and cons of expanding the tablet rollout.
