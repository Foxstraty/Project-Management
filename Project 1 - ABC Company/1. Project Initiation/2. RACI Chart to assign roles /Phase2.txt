As the lead project manager for the ABC Company project, youâ€™re managing the launch of this new service. Previously, you worked with your project team as they developed a marketing plan, wrote promotional copy, designed marketing assets, and created a sales plan for customer outreach.

Now you are gathering a new team to design and develop the ABC Company landing page. When potential customers click on ABC Company advertisements, the landing page is the first part of ABC Company website they will see. The team members you need to build the landing page include: 

Web Manager: Makes final decisions about new site features and content changes. They sign off on the landing page design and launch plans. They also coordinate maintenance and management tasks to keep the page operating smoothly. 

Graphic Designer: Creates and chooses images and typefaces for the landing page and submits them to the Web Designer for approval. They also provide feedback on the landing page design and mockup. 

Web Developer: Supports the product team by writing the code that powers the site. They give feedback to the Web Designer on the landing page mockup. The Web Developer also helps set quality standards for the project.

Quality Assurance Tester: Reviews system specifications and runs quality tests for the new landing page. They run test scripts and review results, create reports, and document technical issues. These tests identify problems that the team can then resolve before launch. 

Content Writer: Creates the written content that explains how ABC Company works and helps potential customers sign up for the service. They give feedback to the Web Designer on the landing page mockup.

Web Designer: Creates the landing page design, determining how the page looks and how customers interact with it. The Web Designer connects the creative and technical elements of the project, ensuring that the website is both attractive and functional. They report to the Web Manager, who makes final decisions on new site features.
