As the project manager for the ABC Company's operations project, you helped develop and implement an Operations and Training plan. You and your team worked on the project for six months and reached a number of milestones. The project is now complete and it's time to create a project closeout report for future project managers to use as a resource. In your closeout report, you will document key accomplishments, open and ongoing items, lessons learned, next steps, and task and milestone duration.
